# bsdoom

This is created like all my code for Gods glory. 
Prise Christ and Saint Maria.

Doom port.
Programming language of choice is C.
I plan to use as little as possible external libs,
if one is used it will be widely portable.
Open source project, openbsd license type.

As for doom, I want decorate mods to work.
Also I want this to handle multiplayer properly.
Main reason is because zandronum is not
anymore capable of developing - it has too strong ties
with zdoom which is at this point dead project.


That should be all for now.
